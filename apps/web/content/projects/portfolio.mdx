This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my coding projects, resume, and skills in a beautifully designed format. I created this website to have an online presence and to share my work with potential employers and clients. The project helped me improve my front-end development skills and learn more about modern web development practices.

## Features

- **Project Showcase**: Display detailed descriptions of coding projects with links to live demos and repositories.
- **Resume Integration**: Include a downloadable version of the resume in PDF format.
- **Skills Section**: Highlight technical and soft skills in an organized and visually appealing way.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for seamless viewing across devices.
- **Blog Section**: Articles written using **MDX**, enabling dynamic content creation.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built using **React** with **Next.js** for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- **Styling**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and modern UI.
- **Content Management**: Leveraged **MDX** to write interactive blogs directly in Markdown.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on **Vercel** for fast and reliable performance.

## Implementation

### Frontend

- **React** components used to create reusable and modular UI elements.
- **Next.js** for static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR).
- **Lenis** for smooth scrolling and navigation between sections.

### Blog Management

- Blogs written in **MDX** to combine Markdown content with React components.
- Dynamic routing in **Next.js** for individual blog pages.

### Deployment

- Continuous deployment using **Vercel** with automatic build triggers from GitHub.
- Optimized performance with lazy loading and image optimization using **Next.js Image**.

## How It Works

1. **Landing Page**: Users are greeted with an introduction and a summary of my skills and experience.
2. **Projects Section**: Detailed view of my projects with links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
3. **About Section**: Overview of my journey, skills, and achievements.
4. **Blog Section**: Users can read technical articles and updates.
5. **Contact Form**: A user-friendly form for inquiries, integrated with **EmailJS** or **Formspree**.

## Challenges Faced

- Achieving smooth and dynamic navigation without compromising performance.
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility for a consistent user experience.
- Managing content dynamically with **MDX** for seamless integration of blogs.

## Future Enhancements
