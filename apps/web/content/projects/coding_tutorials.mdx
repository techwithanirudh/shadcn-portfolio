This is a website offering interactive coding tutorials and challenges to help users learn programming languages through practice. The idea was to create a hands-on learning environment where users can improve their coding skills by solving challenges. This project enhanced my ability to create educational content and interactive web applications.

## Features

- **Interactive Code Editor**: Real-time feedback as users type their code.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials**: Comprehensive lessons with clear explanations and code examples.
- **Challenges & Quizzes**: Test your understanding with engaging challenges and quizzes.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can save their progress and continue learning at their own pace.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Tutorials for various programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and more.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for handling server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for managing user data and tutorial content.
- **Styling**: CSS for sleek and user-friendly designs.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on a cloud platform with CI/CD for seamless updates.

## Implementation

### Frontend

- Built using **React** to create modular and reusable components.
- Interactive elements like code editors implemented using libraries like **Monaco Editor** or **CodeMirror**.
- State management with **React Context API** or **Redux**.

### Backend

- Developed with **Node.js** and **Express** to create RESTful APIs.
- Authentication implemented with **JWT** for secure user sessions.
- API endpoints for handling user data, progress tracking, and challenge validation.

### Database

- **MongoDB** used for storing user details, tutorial content, and progress.
- Optimized queries to ensure smooth and fast data retrieval.

### Deployment

- Hosted on **Vercel** or **Heroku** for the frontend.
- Backend hosted on **AWS EC2** or **Render** with **Docker** for containerization.

## How It Works

1. **User Onboarding**: Users sign up or log in to the platform.
2. **Browse Tutorials**: Explore a list of programming tutorials categorized by skill levels.
3. **Practice & Learn**: Use the in-browser code editor to follow lessons and solve challenges.
4. **Track Progress**: View completed lessons and achievements in the user dashboard.

## Challenges Faced

- Ensuring real-time feedback was accurate and responsive.
- Designing an intuitive UI that works seamlessly across devices.
- Handling scalability as the user base grows.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more programming languages like Ruby and Java.
- Introducing collaborative coding sessions and peer challenges.
- Gamifying the learning experience with leaderboards and badges.
