This is a social app for food lovers where users can post, share, and discover recipes from around the world. I built this app to combine my passion for food and technology, creating a platform where people can connect and share their culinary creations. The project allowed me to work on both front-end and back-end development, enhancing my full-stack development skills.

## Features

- **Recipe Posting**: Users can create and post their recipes with detailed instructions and photos.
- **Recipe Discovery**: Search and explore recipes based on categories, cuisines, or ingredients.
- **User Profiles**: Personalized profiles to showcase user-posted recipes and favorites.
- **Comments and Likes**: Engage with the community by commenting on or liking recipes.
- **Favorites**: Save recipes for quick access later.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with **React** for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: **Node.js** and **Express** for handling server-side logic and APIs.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** for storing recipes, user profiles, and interactions.
- **Styling**: Designed with **CSS** and styled components for a visually appealing UI.
- **Image Hosting**: Integrated with **Cloudinary** for uploading and managing recipe photos.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on **Heroku** or **AWS** for backend and **Vercel** for the frontend.

## Implementation

### Frontend

- **React** used for reusable UI components.
- **React Router** for navigating between pages like home, profiles, and recipe details.
- **Axios** for API integration with the backend.

### Backend

- **Express.js** API endpoints for managing recipes, user authentication, and interactions.
- **JWT** for secure user authentication.
- Middleware for validating and uploading images using **Multer** and **Cloudinary**.

### Database

- **MongoDB** for storing structured data like users, recipes, and comments.
- Indexed queries for fast search and retrieval.
- Data relationships for linking recipes to user profiles.

### Deployment

- Backend deployed on **Heroku** with Dockerized containers.
- Frontend deployed on **Vercel** with CI/CD for seamless updates.

## How It Works

1. **User Onboarding**: Sign up or log in to start exploring and sharing recipes.
2. **Post Recipes**: Upload recipes with images, categories, and detailed steps.
3. **Discover Recipes**: Use search or filters to find recipes based on your taste.
4. **Engage with Community**: Like, comment, and save your favorite recipes.
5. **Personalize Profile**: Showcase your culinary creations on your profile page.

## Challenges Faced
