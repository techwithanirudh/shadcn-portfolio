This is a mobile app that helps users track their fitness activities, set goals, and monitor progress with motivational tools. I created this app to encourage people to lead a healthier lifestyle by making fitness tracking simple and engaging. The project allowed me to delve into mobile development and learn more about user-centered design and data management.

## Features

- **Activity Tracking**: Log daily fitness activities such as walking, running, cycling, and gym workouts.
- **Goal Setting**: Users can set fitness goals for specific durations and activities.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Visual progress reports through charts and graphs.
- **Motivational Tools**: Daily tips, streak tracking, and achievement badges.
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Tailored experience for users based on their fitness preferences.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with **React Native** for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Backend**: **Node.js** and **Express** for handling server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** for storing user data, activity logs, and goals.
- **Styling**: Custom styles with **CSS-in-JS** libraries like Styled Components.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Integrated with libraries like **Victory Native** or **Recharts** for visual data representation.
- **Hosting**: Backend deployed on **AWS** or **Heroku**, and the app distributed via **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store**.

## Implementation

### Frontend
